# Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my PGP in AI & ML from Great Learning. It involves statistical analysis of real-world data, applying various statistical techniques to derive meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions.

# Key Objectives
  * **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.
  * **Conduct Hypothesis Testing** (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square) to validate assumptions.
  * **Build and evaluate Regression Models** (Linear, Multiple Regression).
  * **Derive Business Insights & Recommendations** based on statistical findings

# Tools & Libraries Used
  * Python (Jupyter Notebook)
  * Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
  * SciPy (Statistical Analysis)

# Analysis Performed
  * Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  * Descriptive Statistics & EDA
  * Hypothesis Testing (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests)
  * Regression Analysis (Linear, Multiple Regression)
  * Interpretation & Insights
